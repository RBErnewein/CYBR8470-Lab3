### Step 6: Post Request

Can't POST using App Key. No access to the user.

I was not able to POST under a user context after resetting the Authorization to Oauth 1. Based on the writeup, I assumed that the Token Secret was the same as the Consumer Secret. I also tried multiple combinations of the user ID & Access Token for the Token Secret without success.

Note: The inteface in the current version of Postman differs greatly from the writeup. Fields and settings don't matchup well.
